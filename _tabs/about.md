Greetings! 👋 I'm Nga, Python Engineer with 5+ years of hands-on experience. I'm passionate about leveraging Python's power to build robust applications. With my knowledge of AWS services and Linux, I enjoy architecting scalable solutions that seamlessly blend code and infrastructure. Here you’ll find various articles about some of my insights and challenges long my software development journey.

I hope you enjoy the content. If you’d like to reach out, the best place right now is to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngahoangvan/) or go to my [Github]. Thanks!

Fact: What does `jhoangv` mean? My full Vietnamese name is Hoang Van Nga, and my English name is Jacob. Therefore, `jhoangv` stands for Jacob Hoang V (a blend of Vietnamese and English). I had originally intended to purchase the domain named `jacobhoang.com`, but unfortunately, it's not available on AWS. So I decided to use `jhoangv` 😁😁😁.
